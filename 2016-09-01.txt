Some goals:
	talk about transport layer.

TCP: connection-oriented
	provides reliable ordered byte stream
	flow control
	congestion control
	used by applications: web, file transfer, remote login, email
################
===Congestion===
################
delay is caused by queuing
loss is caused by queue overflow
The packets are arriving faster than they can be serviced
The internet needs congestion control to avoid persistent queue overflow

===TCP CONGESTION CONTROL===

UDP lets you send a packet and doesn't resend dropped packets.
connectionless
unreliable
no flow control
no congestion control
good for:
	broadcasting to DHCP
	query response
	DNS

===NETWORK LAYER SERVICES===
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
routing protocols
stability : paths must not change too often
scalability : must handle ever possible destination on the internet
policy : allow network administration to choose paths based on economic agreements between providers
security : 


&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
===LINK AND PHYSICAL LAYERS===
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
link layers: sends a frame on one link
physical layer: sends bits on one link

===SECURITY===
**************
Was NOT considered when the internet was built
goal when making it: develop one internetwork for all existing networks
second lvl goals:
	survivability: continue working through natural disasters and stuff. need to be a distrubuted system (we thought of that becuase it was being developed during the cold war
	multiple types of services : up front they wanted to support a variety of networks
	distributed management
	cost effective
	host attachment with low effort
	accountable resources

We've been playing cat and mouse since the creation.
When email was set up, it was to leave online chat messages to someone who is not online at the time.
magnification attacks!!!! Try it with a botnet!!! even better!!!


^^^^^^^^^^^^^
===SOCKETS===
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
to talk to a process on another machine, you nedd to identify it
	- ip address : identifies the machine
	- port number : identifies the socket the process is using
IP addresses identify an interface, not a machine
ifconfig will list all of your interfaces
